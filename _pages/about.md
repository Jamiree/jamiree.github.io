Currently working under the advisory of Enoch Yeung in the Biological Control Lab [(BCL)](https://yeung.me.ucsb.edu/) in the department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara. 

My current projects:
======

-Developing a hybrid promoter library which will provide a number of promoters with distinct gene activation profiles in both log and stationary phase.  

-Validating time-varying genetic circuit models proposed and analyzed in my [paper](paper1.pdf) using the promoters from my hybrid promoter library.

Interests : Control theory, mathematical modeling, system identification, optimization, data science, numerical analysis

Bio:
======

My research career started in high school when I got an internship at the Center for Advanced Surgical and Interventional Technology at UCLA.  Here, I helped in the design and testing of a novel prostate cancer treatment method called focal laser ablation.  During my B.S. in Applied Math at UC San Diego, I was a supplemental Instructor for pre-calculus, calculus, and linear algebra courses for three out of the four years of my undergraduate career.  I got into the University of California Leadership Excellence through Advanced Degrees Program (UC LEADs) in which I gained funding for my undergraduate research. Through UC LEADs, I was able to conduct research in the Coimbra Research Group at UC San Diego working on numerical methods for solving variable order differential equations.  I also used this funding to perform computational simulations of respiratory drug intake in the human trachea in the Delplanque Research Group at UC Davis.  After several varied research experiences, I began my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at UC Santa Barbara with the Mechanical Engineering Excellence Fellowship. Here, I have expanded my expertise further in mathematical modeling, data science, and control theory for applications in biological systems under the supervision of Dr. Enoch Yeung in the Biological Control Lab.
