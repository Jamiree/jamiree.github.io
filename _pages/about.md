Currently working under the advisory of Enoch Yeung in the Biological Control Lab [(BCL)](https://yeung.me.ucsb.edu/) in the department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara. 

My current projects:

-Developing a hybrid promoter library which will provide a number of promoters which have distinct gene activation profiles in both log and stationary phase.  

-Validating time-varying genetic toggle switch models (proposed and analyzed in my [paper](paper1.pdf) using the promoters from my library.

Interests : Control theory, bio-controls, mathematical modeling, system identification, numerical analysis

For more detailed info on my coursework, experience, and skillset, please see my [CV](http://jamiree.github.io/files/CV_Jamiree_Harrison.pdf) .
