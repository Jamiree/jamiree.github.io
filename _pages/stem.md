I've compiled a list of STEM Resources because I wanted to share effective teaching tools that have helped me. 
This list is of course not exhaustive, so if you come across a good/fun resource feel free to send it my way.  
There's numerous textbooks on each subject mentioned, so I thought to provide more audio-visual and interactive supplemental resources.  If you're interested in which which textbooks I would recommend, feel free to email me. 

Learn Math: 
- [Paul's online math notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/) has everything for high school and undergraduate students learning math.  Notes, Practice problems with step-by-step solutions, clear explanations, and it's free and easy to access.  

- For linear algebra, calculus, and more, check out the series by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw).

- For abstract algebra, number theory, mathematica, and more, check out [Socratica](https://www.youtube.com/@Socratica/playlists).

- For nonlinear dynamical systems and more, check out [Shane Ross](https://www.youtube.com/user/RossDynamicsLab).  He's kind enough to upload many lectures to youtube for free. 

- For nonlinear dynamical systems, applied linear algebra, operator theory, machine learning, koopman operator theory, etc. check out [Nathan Kutz](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoUOaSVYkTV6W4uLvxvgiFA).  He's kind enough to upload many lectures to youtube for free. 

- For network systems, check out [Francesco Bullo](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=francesco+bullo). He's kind enough to upload many lectures to youtube for free. 

- For Koopman operator theory and dynamical systems, check out [Igor Mezic](https://www.youtube.com/@igormezic5715/videos). He's kind enough to upload many lectures to youtube for free. 

- For general math interest, check out [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/@numberphile).
