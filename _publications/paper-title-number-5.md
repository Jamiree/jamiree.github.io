A wide array of E. coli promoters activate during stationary phase. Due to the role of sigma factors, these promoters are distinct from promoters active in exponential growth phase. Design of large-scale, synthetic biological networks demands the judicious selection of promoters — bioproduction, biosensing, and biocircuit engineering efforts thus become highly sensitive to reactor or environmental conditions. Consequentially, engineered synthetic gene networks often have a narrow operational envelope centered around a particular growth phase. We explore a new class of promoter sequences that enable synthetic gene expression in multiple growth phases. We develop a mutagenized library of promoters hybridized from two phase-specific promoters: 1) a stationary-phase promoter from the osmolarity shock pathway and 2) a synthetic, log-phase promoter from the Anderson promoter library. The elements of our hybrid promoter library have been shown to display distinct gene expression phenotypes during the different phases of the cell population’s life cycle. We use k-means to cluster and analyze the time-series phenotypes of our library. To date, promoter models typically predict steady-state gene expression activity using thermodynamics and machine learning, or with ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which contain static parameters. We formulate and validate time-varying ODE models which encapsulate the inherent time-varying parameters and dynamics within our library. The estimation of model parameters involves an algorithm we developed, grounded in the principles of nonlinear optimization to obtain accurate n-step reconstructions of multi-phasic gene expression data.
